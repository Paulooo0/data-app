# Project Description

This project involves creating a dashboard for data analysis and insight generation using the kc_data_house.csv dataset. The GUI would be developed using the Streamlit library, and the web application is hosted on the Streamlit Community Cloud.

# Functionalities and Demonstration

`Feature 1` - Data Overview

* This dataframe shows all the elements that can be filtered by the two buttons on the sidebar, which I will talk about soon.

`Feature 2` - Statistics

* Average values: based on the zipcodes, shows you the average data, referent each zipcode. And can be filtered by the zipcode button on side bar.
* Descriptive analysis: shows the statistics for each attribute in the dataframe.

`Feature 3` - Side bar

* Have two buttons: one can filter by the zip code, and the other can filter by column name. Additionally, the side bar have a slider bar, that can filter by the maximum year built.

`Feature 4` - Portfolio density

* The interactive map displays the attributes of each property at every point on the map.

`Feature 5` - Commercial attributes

* Average price by year built: shows a line graph (price x yr_built) that can be filtered by the slider bar.
* Average price by day: shows a line graph representing the medium price per day in a certain period (05/2014-05/2015).
